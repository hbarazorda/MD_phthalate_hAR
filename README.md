# Phthalate‚ÄìAndrogen Receptor Interaction Analysis

This repository contains the computational workflow and datasets for the study:  
**"In Silico Exploration of the Endocrine-Disrupting Potential of Phthalate Esters through Structural Interaction with the Human Androgen Receptor"**, which investigates the endocrine-disrupting potential of phthalate esters using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD), MM/PBSA free energy calculations, and non-covalent interaction analysis.

## üìã Project Description

Phthalate esters (PAEs) are environmental pollutants that may disrupt androgen receptor (AR) signaling. This project explores how 88 phthalate compounds interact with the human androgen receptor ligand-binding domain (PDB ID: 2AM9), using:

- **Multi-platform virtual screening** (DockThor, AutoDock Vina, iGEMDOCK)
- **Molecular Dynamics Simulations** (GROMACS, 500 ns)
- **Binding Free Energy Calculations** (MM/PBSA)
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Free Energy Landscape (FEL)**
- **Non-covalent Interaction Profiling** (PLIP)

## üß™ Methodology

1. **Ligand Preparation**

   - Standardized, optimized, and protonated at physiological pH.

2. **Receptor Preparation**
   - PDB structure: `2AM9`
   - Cleaned, hydrogenated, and minimized using CHARMM-GUI.

3. **Virtual Screening**
   - Docking tools: DockThor, AutoDock Vina (via PyRx), and iGEMDOCK.
   - Top ligands selected based on consensus scoring.

4. **Molecular Dynamics**
   - Software: GROMACS v2023 with CHARMM36 force field.
   - Solvation with TIP3P water, 500 ns production run per complex.

5. **Binding Energy**
   - Tool: `gmx_MMPBSA`
   - Free energy decomposition and entropy correction included.

6. **Structural Analysis**
   - RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA
   - PCA & FEL
   - B-factor and non-covalent interaction visualization (PLIP)
